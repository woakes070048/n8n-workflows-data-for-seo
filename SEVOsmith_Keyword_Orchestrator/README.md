# SEVOsmith Keyword Orchestrator

> The Definitive Engine for Fully Automated Keyword Research using n8n and DataForSEO.

Your keyword research process is broken. It's a chaotic scramble across a dozen different tools, a manual grind of merging messy CSVs, and a constant battle against brittle workflows that fail silently. This isn't strategy; it's a bottleneck that kills efficiency and drains your budget on redundant API calls.

The **SEVOsmith Keyword Orchestrator** is the delivery on the promise of true automation. It's not a simple template; it's a production-grade system, engineered to execute a complete, multi-vector **n8n keyword research** strategy from start to finish.

## 🤖 Key Features

This system is designed to turn the raw, disconnected data from **DataForSEO** into a cohesive, actionable intelligence report.

🧠 **360-Degree Intelligence Gathering**
The Orchestrator deploys nine parallel agents to query the entire search ecosystem using **DataForSEO**—from Google and YouTube SERPs to AI Overviews and search intent signals.

🎯 **Automated Synthesis Core**
The system's code-based "brain" ingests the chaotic outputs from all APIs and programmatically unifies them into a single, clean, and structured data object. It's the alchemist that forges your "Strategic Report."

🔍 **Production-Grade Resilience & Error Handling**
Every API call is individually validated. Any failure is instantly caught, logged in your control sheet, and triggers an email notification—without halting the entire process.

🔄 **Zero-Waste Caching Engine**
True automation is efficient. The integrated caching layer checks for existing research before every run, delivering instant results on repeat queries and saving you significant **DataForSEO** API costs.

🌐 **Instant, Interactive Deliverables**
The final "Strategic Report" is more than a data dump. It's a professional, self-contained HTML document with filterable tables, dynamic charts, and automated topic clustering.

1.  **Job Initiation & State Management:** A robust, stateful job queue using Google Sheets ensures every research task is processed reliably (`To_Do` -> `Processing` -> `Completed`).

2.  **Intelligent Caching & Cost Control:** A unique `cache_key` is generated for each job. The workflow queries an internal n8n Data Table first, bypassing all API calls on a cache hit.

3.  **The Parallel Data-Fetch Core:** On a cache miss, it simultaneously queries nine **DataForSEO** endpoints, with real-time validation to ensure the system is resilient and never fails silently.

4.  **The Synthesis Engine—The Single Source of Truth:** A sophisticated JavaScript node (`Normalize_and_Compact`) programmatically cleans and reshapes varied JSON into a single, predictable data model.

5.  **Interactive Report Generation & Data Persistence:** Transforms the synthesized data into the polished, interactive HTML report and an optional raw data Google Sheet.

6.  **Delivery, Caching & Finalization:** Handles the "last mile" tasks: uploading reports, sending a notification email, saving new data to the cache, and updating the job's status.
