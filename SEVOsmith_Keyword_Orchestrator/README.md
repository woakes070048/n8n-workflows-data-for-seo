# SEVOsmith Keyword Orchestrator: From Raw Data to Strategic Report - Fully Automated Keyword Research using n8n and DataForSEO


### Your keyword research is a bottleneck. This is the engine that breaks it.

Let's be honest. Your current keyword research process is broken. It's a chaotic scramble across a dozen different tools, a manual grind of merging messy CSVs, and a constant battle against brittle workflows that fail silently.

You spend 80% of your time wrestling with data and only 20% on actual strategy. You're drained by repetitive tasks, your API budget is wasted on redundant calls, and you're delivering static reports that are obsolete the moment you export them. This isn't a scalable system; it's a strategic bottleneck.

**The SEVOsmith Keyword Orchestrator is the definitive engine for fully automated keyword research using n8n and DataForSEO.**

It's not just another template; it's a production-grade system engineered to eliminate the bottleneck entirely. It executes a complete, multi-vector intelligence-gathering mission and delivers a final, interactive report—transforming raw data into strategic insight, every single time.

## 1. The Solution: How It Solves Your Problems

Instead of just giving you data, the Orchestrator delivers a suite of solutions designed to give you back time, money, and strategic focus.

#### ✅ **From Chaos to Clarity: The Interactive Strategic Report**
Forget impenetrable spreadsheets. The workflow's final deliverable is a polished, self-contained HTML intelligence report. Instantly grasp a topic's viability with a high-level dashboard, interactive charts, and powerful data tables that put you in control. Filter, sort, search, and export with ease.

#### ✅ **Eliminates Wasted Spend with a Zero-Waste Caching Engine**
True automation is ruthlessly efficient. The integrated caching layer checks for existing research before every single run. If the research exists, you get your report instantly while bypassing all API calls, saving you significant time and directly reducing your **DataForSEO** API costs.

#### ✅ **Provides a 360-Degree View of the Search Landscape**
To create content that ranks and gets cited by AI, you need a multi-dimensional picture. The Orchestrator queries nine distinct data sources in parallel—from Google and YouTube SERPs to "People Also Ask" and Google's AI Overviews—to build an unparalleled understanding of user intent and competitor strategy.

#### ✅ **Engineered for Resilience, Not Failure**
A workflow that breaks on a single failed API call isn't "automated." We've built this system for production-level resilience. Every API call is individually validated. Any failure is instantly caught, logged, and triggers an email notification—without ever halting the entire process.

## 3. The Potential: Your New Automation Launchpad

The Keyword Orchestrator is not the end of your automation journey; it's the powerful beginning. When you run this workflow, you get two key assets you can immediately build upon:

### **A. The Interactive HTML Report: For Human Intelligence**

This is your communication and rapid-analysis tool.
*   **Immediately Validate a Topic:** Use the high-level dashboard to quickly decide if a keyword is worth pursuing before investing more resources.
*   **Deliver Professional Insights:** Share the password-protected HTML file directly with clients or stakeholders to deliver a polished, easy-to-understand intelligence briefing.

### **B. The Raw JSON Object: For Machine Intelligence**

This is the crown jewel for any automator. The final, structured JSON data is a "Single Source of Truth" meticulously designed to be the input for other n8n workflows. You can use it to launch:

*   **An Autonomous Competitor Analysis Engine:**
    *   **How:** Extract the `organic_top20` URLs from the JSON object. Pass this list to a new n8n workflow that uses a scraping tool (like Firecrawl) and an AI agent to perform a deep-dive analysis on the structure, word count, and key arguments of every top-ranking competitor.

*   **An AI-Powered Article Creation Pipeline:**
    *   **How:** Feed the `primary_keyword`, `paa_questions`, `related_searches`, and `topic_clusters` from the JSON directly into the context of an LLM prompt. This creates a data-driven content brief that an "Outline Architect Agent" can use to generate a competitively superior article structure.

*   **A Multi-Platform SEvO Strategy:**
    *   **How:** Use the `youtube_top_videos` array from the JSON to feed another AI agent. Task it with analyzing the top titles and angles to generate a unique script, title, and description for a companion YouTube video, ensuring you build authority across multiple search platforms simultaneously.

### The Anatomy of a Strategic Report: Why Nine APIs?

To create truly authoritative content that can be cited by AI, generic keyword data is not enough. You need a multi-dimensional understanding of the search landscape. This workflow calls nine distinct DataForSEO endpoints in parallel to build this comprehensive picture, providing the essential intelligence needed to build a winning content strategy from the ground up.

Here’s why each API call is critical:

#### **Group 1: SERP Landscape & User Behavior Analysis**
*These APIs provide a real-time snapshot of what users see and what Google's AI thinks is important.*

1.  **SERP Google:** Provides the top organic results (organic), "People Also Ask" questions (people_also_ask), and "Related Searches" (related_searches).
    *   **Strategic Purpose:** This is the foundational data for understanding user psychology. It reveals the exact questions users are asking and identifies the top-ranking competitors you must outperform.

2.  **SERP YouTube:** Gathers the top-ranking videos, titles, and popular angles for the topic on YouTube.
    *   **Strategic Purpose:** This directly fuels a "Search Everywhere" (SEvO) strategy. By understanding what works on YouTube, you can create a dedicated video strategy that complements your written article, ensuring multi-platform authority.

3.  **AI Mode:** Fetches Google's SGE (AI-Generated Experience) overview (ai_overview) for the query.
    *   **Strategic Purpose:** This is crucial for Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). It reveals how AI models summarize your topic, allowing you to identify the core concepts and authoritative sources you must include to be cited by AI.

#### **Group 2: Keyword Opportunity & Expansion**
*These APIs find the hidden keyword opportunities your competitors might be missing.*

4.  **Keyword Ideas:** Discovers a broad set of thematically related keywords with full metrics.
5.  **Related Keywords:** EExtracts the specific keywords found in the "Searches related to" element on Google.
    *   **Strategic Purpose:** The outputs from both APIs create a comprehensive pool of keyword opportunities. This raw data can be programmatically scored for relevance, search volume, and difficulty, allowing you to prioritize the most valuable "winnable" terms and expand your content's reach.

#### **Group 3: Core Metrics & Intent Validation**
*These APIs provide the hard, quantitative data needed to validate the strategy.*

6.  **Keyword Overview:** Pulls the definitive search volume, CPC, and keyword difficulty for the primary keyword.
    *   **Strategic Purpose:** Provides the headline metrics for the final HTML report and validates the commercial viability of the topic.

7.  **Search Intent:** Categorizes the primary keyword's intent (Informational, Commercial, etc.).
    *   **Strategic Purpose:** This is a critical validation step. It ensures your content's core angle and call-to-action align perfectly with what users are actually trying to accomplish (e.g., learn, compare, or buy).

8.  **AI Keyword Data:** Gathers search volume data derived from questions in "People Also Ask" (ai_search_volume).
    *   **Strategic Purpose:** This acts as a powerful proxy for voice search and conversational queries. It highlights the importance of structuring content in a question-and-answer format to capture featured snippets and satisfy user curiosity.

#### **Group 4: Topical Authority & Content Structure**
*This API helps structure the content for machine readability and AI citation.*

9.  **Generate Subtopics:** Uses AI to break down the primary topic into a logical hierarchy of sub_topics.
    *   **Strategic Purpose:** This provides a foundational structure for building a comprehensive, data-driven article outline that is easy for both users and search engines to understand, ensuring complete topical coverage.

### The Six Modules of Automation

1.  **Job Initiation & State Management:** A robust, stateful job queue using Google Sheets ensures every research task is processed reliably (`To_Do` -> `Processing` -> `Completed`).

2.  **Intelligent Caching & Cost Control:** A unique `cache_key` is generated for each job. The workflow queries an internal n8n Data Table first, bypassing all API calls on a cache hit.

3.  **The Parallel Data-Fetch Core:** On a cache miss, it simultaneously queries nine **DataForSEO** endpoints, with real-time validation to ensure the system is resilient and never fails silently.

4.  **The Synthesis Engine—The Single Source of Truth:** A sophisticated JavaScript node (`Normalize_and_Compact`) programmatically cleans and reshapes varied JSON into a single, predictable data model.

5.  **Interactive Report Generation & Data Persistence:** Transforms the synthesized data into the polished, interactive HTML report and an optional raw data Google Sheet.

6.  **Delivery, Caching & Finalization:** Handles the "last mile" tasks: uploading reports, sending a notification email, saving new data to the cache, and updating the job's status.

*   The workflow will trigger, updating the status to `Processing` and finally `Completed` or `Error`.
*   Check your email or the sheet for links to the deliverables.

![SEVOsmith Keyword Orchestrator: Email notification when report is ready](screenshots/Email-Notify-Research-Report-is-Ready.jpg)

#### **Troubleshooting**
*   **Workflow Doesn't Trigger:** Ensure `Action` and `Status` values are exact (case-sensitive).
*   **Execution Fails:** Check the `Notes` column in the sheet and your email for a detailed error message.
*   **File Upload Fails:** Confirm the Google Drive Folder ID is correct and your credential has write permissions.

---
### Part 3: Key Considerations & Best Practices

*   **Critical: Google OAuth Scopes:** When creating your `Google OAuth2` credential, ensure you enable scopes for **both** Sheets (`.../auth/spreadsheets`) and Drive (`.../auth/drive`).
*   **Understanding Caching:** The first run for a unique keyword is a "cache miss" and uses APIs. Subsequent runs are "cache hits" and are instant and free.
*   **Managing API Costs:** The `Litmit` parameter in your settings sheet controls the depth of research and directly impacts your DataForSEO API costs.
*   **Error Handling:** The workflow has a built-in error path that will catch API failures, update your sheet with a specific error, and send an alert email.
*
