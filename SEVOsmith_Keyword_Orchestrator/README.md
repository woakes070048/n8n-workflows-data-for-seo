# SEVOsmith Keyword Orchestrator: From Raw Data to Strategic Report - Fully Automated Keyword Research using n8n and DataForSEO


Your keyword research process is broken. It's a chaotic scramble across a dozen different tools, a manual grind of merging messy CSVs, and a constant battle against brittle workflows that fail silently. This isn't strategy; it's a bottleneck that kills efficiency and drains your budget on redundant API calls.

The **SEVOsmith Keyword Orchestrator** is the delivery on the promise of true automation. It's not a simple template; it's a production-grade system, engineered to execute a complete, multi-vector **n8n keyword research** strategy from start to finish.

## 🤖 Key Features

This system is designed to turn the raw, disconnected data from **DataForSEO** into a cohesive, actionable intelligence report.

#### 🧠 360-Degree Raw Data Gathering
The Orchestrator deploys nine parallel agents to query the entire search ecosystem using **DataForSEO**—from Google and YouTube SERPs to AI Overviews and search intent signals. This is the "Raw Data" firehose, comprehensively collected.

#### 🎯 The Automated Synthesis Core
This is where data becomes strategy. The system's code-based "brain" ingests the chaotic outputs from all APIs and programmatically unifies them into a single, clean, and structured data object. It's the alchemist that forges your "Strategic Report."

#### 🔍 Production-Grade Resilience & Error Handling
A workflow that breaks on a single failed API call isn't "Fully Automated." Every API call is individually validated. Any failure is instantly caught, logged, and triggers an email notification—without halting the entire process.

#### 🔄 The Zero-Waste Caching Engine
True automation is efficient. The integrated caching layer checks for existing research before every run, delivering instant results on repeat queries and saving you significant **DataForSEO** API costs.

#### 🌐 Instant, Interactive Deliverables
The final "Strategic Report" is more than a data dump. It's a professional, self-contained HTML document with filterable tables, dynamic charts, and automated topic clustering, ready for stakeholders or clients.

## 🚀 How It Works: The Six Modules of Automation

1.  **Job Initiation & State Management:** A robust, stateful job queue using Google Sheets ensures every research task is processed reliably (`To_Do` -> `Processing` -> `Completed`).

2.  **Intelligent Caching & Cost Control:** A unique `cache_key` is generated for each job. The workflow queries an internal n8n Data Table first, bypassing all API calls on a cache hit.

3.  **The Parallel Data-Fetch Core:** On a cache miss, it simultaneously queries nine **DataForSEO** endpoints, with real-time validation to ensure the system is resilient and never fails silently.

4.  **The Synthesis Engine—The Single Source of Truth:** A sophisticated JavaScript node (`Normalize_and_Compact`) programmatically cleans and reshapes varied JSON into a single, predictable data model.

5.  **Interactive Report Generation & Data Persistence:** Transforms the synthesized data into the polished, interactive HTML report and an optional raw data Google Sheet.

6.  **Delivery, Caching & Finalization:** Handles the "last mile" tasks: uploading reports, sending a notification email, saving new data to the cache, and updating the job's status.

## 🛠️ Setup & User Guide

### Prerequisites:
*   An active n8n instance.
*   Credentials for: **DataForSEO**, **Google (OAuth2)**, **Gmail (OAuth2)**, and an **S3-compatible service** (like Cloudflare R2).

---
### Part 1: Setup Checklist

#### **Step 1: Environment & Asset Preparation**
1.  **Import Workflow:** Import the `SEVOsmith_Keyword_Orchestrator_v1.1.json` file into your n8n instance.
2.  **Create G-Drive Structure:**
    *   `SEVOsmith` (Main Folder)
        *   `KW_research_report` (Sub-folder)
        *   `KW_research_raw_data` (Sub-folder)
3.  **Copy Template Files:**
    *   **Manager Sheet:** [Copy this template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ssyXqC1JCJhjvrzwByoVf1QWLNZQ4P3K6HcJuhNOymM/edit?gid=484582664#gid=484582664), name it `SEVOsmith_Manager_Sheet`, and move it into your `SEVOsmith` folder.
    *   **Raw Data Template:** [Copy this template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CZsJ5Mh2cwh6i0WlDb3HaBk96_bBm71HLkBAZneYvYY/edit?gid=2108933567#gid=2108933567), name it `KW_Research_Template_Source`, and move it into your `KW_research_raw_data` folder.
4.  **Create n8n Data Table:** In n8n, go to "Data tables" and create a table named `SEVOsmith_KW_Cache` with four `String` columns: `Project`, `session_id`, `cache_id`, `cache_content`.

#### **Step 2: Configuration**
1.  **Create n8n Credentials:** In n8n, create the necessary credentials: `HTTP Basic Auth` (for DataForSEO), `Google OAuth2`, `Gmail OAuth2`, and `AWS` (for S3/R2).
2.  **Populate Settings Sheet:** Open your `SEVOsmith_Manager_Sheet`, go to the `KW_Reseach_Setting` tab, and populate the values.

| Setting Name | Your Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Location Code | `2840` |
| Language Code | `en` |
| Litmit | `50` |
| Upload to G-drive | `Yes` |
| Upload to Cloudflade R2 | `Yes` |
| Save Raw Data | `Yes` |
| Email Notify | `Yes` |
| Email to receive report | `your.email@example.com` |
| **Google Drive Folder id** | *<ID of your `KW_research_report` folder>* |
| **Cloudflade R2 link** | *<Your public R2/S3 bucket URL>* |

#### **Step 3: Connect, Save, and Activate**
1.  **Assign Credentials** to all relevant nodes in the workflow.
2.  **Connect Google Sheet IDs:**
    *   Paste the ID of your `SEVOsmith_Manager_Sheet` into the `Document ID` field of all Google Sheets nodes.
    *   Paste the ID of your `KW_Research_Template_Source` into the `File ID` field of the `Google Drive Copy KW Template` node.
3.  **Connect Data Table:** Select your `SEVOsmith_KW_Cache` table in the `Get Cache` and `Create Cache` nodes.
4.  **Save and Activate** the workflow.

---
### Part 2: Usage & Troubleshooting

#### **Running a Job**
*   To start a job, add a row to the `Campaign Start` tab, setting `Action` to `Submit` and `Status` to `To_Do`.
*   The workflow will trigger, updating the status to `Processing` and finally `Completed` or `Error`.
*   Check your email or the sheet for links to the deliverables.

#### **Troubleshooting**
*   **Workflow Doesn't Trigger:** Ensure `Action` and `Status` values are exact (case-sensitive).
*   **Execution Fails:** Check the `Notes` column in the sheet and your email for a detailed error message.
*   **File Upload Fails:** Confirm the Google Drive Folder ID is correct and your credential has write permissions.

---
### Part 3: Key Considerations & Best Practices

*   **Critical: Google OAuth Scopes:** When creating your `Google OAuth2` credential, ensure you enable scopes for **both** Sheets (`.../auth/spreadsheets`) and Drive (`.../auth/drive`).
*   **Understanding Caching:** The first run for a unique keyword is a "cache miss" and uses APIs. Subsequent runs are "cache hits" and are instant and free.
*   **Managing API Costs:** The `Litmit` parameter in your settings sheet controls the depth of research and directly impacts your DataForSEO API costs.
*   **Error Handling:** The workflow has a built-in error path that will catch API failures, update your sheet with a specific error, and send an alert email.
